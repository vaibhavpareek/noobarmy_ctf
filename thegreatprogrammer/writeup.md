## THE GREAT PROGRAMMER

### Let's Analyze the webpage , ohhhhhhh there are multiple links on this website somewhere around 4000.

### So , i am going to check every link if it gives me my flag....

## INNER ME : NOOOOOOO!! you are a programmer , use your programming skills to find out the valid link.

## LET's write a script!!!!

### Script is available in this repo only with the name solve.py (I have used python for scripting )

### Script ch.py was created to generate these random string or i should say false links

### After Running the script you must have got only one valid link rest all are false links.


```
Step1 : pr_magic_fun.php is the file which exists on server and have flag in it

Step2 : Extract the flag from that file!!!
```

## Hurray !!!

## You got the Flag : noob{p3ro_graMM3r_r0cks!!}

## Done!!
